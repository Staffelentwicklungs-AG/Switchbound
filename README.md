# Switchbound<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Hollow Knight / Celeste<br/>
Genre: 2D Puzzle Platformer<br/>
USP: Player can switch between two color-coded worlds to solve platforming puzzles.<br/>
Main focus: World swapping logic, platforming, basic level design.<br/>
<br/>

Notes:<br/>
Player: Last survivor of his race where balance still reigned, curious (The Keeper of the Balance (working title), must be found or learn what happened to him to restore the old balance)<br/>
Artifact: Amulet, ring, bracelet / enables the switch between worlds<br/>
Worlds: Light world / covenant, harmonious, orderly<br/>
Shadow world / dark contrast, mystical, freedom<br/>
Both: Obstacles (objects or monsters)<br/>

Story<br/>
<br/>
In a once harmonious world, guarded by the "Guardian of Balance," a power struggle between light and shadow ensues when the guardian disappears.<br/>
The Light faction aims to create a pure and orderly world, while the Shadow faction seeks to retain freedoms.<br/>
The conflict splits the world into two dimensions: the radiant and orderly light world, and the chaotic shadow world.<br/>
The player, one of the last survivors from the original world, is bestowed with an artifact that grants the ability to navigate between the worlds.<br/>
Their mission is to restore balance, but they face challenges from both sides seeking to maintain the status quo.<br/>
The truth about the guardian's disappearance holds the key to everything, making the journey even more difficult.<br/>

Game Design<br/>
<br/>
Switchbound is a 2D-Puzzle Platformer that requires critical thinking in the pursuit of finding a path.
The other key aspect will be to fight opponents that are obstacles on this path. Light an Dark both vye for domination in the world, thus
making our protagonist anathema to the current order/disorder.
Platforms and Puzzles are the mandatory to complete the game, combat is a valid approach, but should be limited as a mandatory condition to beat 
a level.
Levels are consecutively organized to lead the player through the story of the game. Interactable NPCs provide support or exposition for hints to
beat the level. Otherwise try and error methods should provide the player with a sense of exploration, picking up the clues from the environment.
The protagonist unlocks new abilities and equipment from exploring the game environment.

Character<br/>
<br/>
Our protagonist is caught in a dream, its contradicting sides fighting each other and getting out of control. It will be a key feature 
to balance around both sides, while keeping to one provides benefits and repercussions of their own. Reflecting the stereotypical attributes of
Light and Dark, Order and freedom, the protagonist appearance, move selection and abilities are bound to the form it currently inhabits.
Puzzles and enemies require the players to switch between the forms regularly to overcome the obstacle.

Leveldesign<br/>
Primarily the protagonist tries to climb up a mountain ridge. ???TBC
