# Switchbound<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
 - Scripting<br/>
 - Scene building<br/>
 - Asset integration<br/>
 - UI and UX basics<br/>
 - Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Hollow Knight / Celeste<br/>
Genre: 2D Puzzle Platformer<br/>
USP: Player can switch between two color-coded worlds to solve platforming puzzles.<br/>
Main focus: World swapping logic, platforming, basic level design.<br/>
<br/>

Notes:<br/>
Player: Last survivor of his race where balance still reigned, curious (The Keeper of the Balance – working title), must be found or learn what happened to him to restore the old balance.<br/>
Artifact: Amulet, ring, or bracelet that enables switching between worlds.<br/>
Worlds: <b>Light world</b> (harmonious, covenant, orderly) / <b>Shadow world</b> (dark contrast, mystical, freedom)<br/>
Both: Feature obstacles – objects or monsters.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Switchbound</b><br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Story</b><br/><br/>
In a once harmonious world guarded by the "Guardian of Balance," a power struggle between light and shadow begins after the guardian disappears.<br/>
The Light faction aims to create a pure, orderly world, while the Shadow faction seeks to preserve freedom.<br/>
The world splits into two dimensions: the radiant Light World and the chaotic Shadow World.<br/>
The player – one of the last survivors of the original world – is granted an artifact that allows them to switch between the two.<br/>
Their mission: to restore balance while uncovering the truth behind the Guardian’s disappearance. Both factions try to maintain their version of order, becoming obstacles to the player’s journey.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Game Design</b><br/><br/>
Switchbound is a 2D Puzzle Platformer focused on navigating environmental puzzles through world switching.<br/>
Combat is possible, but optional – not the core way to finish levels.<br/>
Levels are designed to guide the player through the narrative, and NPCs offer clues or minor assistance. Trial and error fosters exploration and learning.<br/>
New abilities and gear can be discovered through exploration.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Character</b><br/><br/>
The protagonist is trapped in a dream where Light and Shadow fight for control.<br/>
Each form – Light or Shadow – offers different abilities and appearances, with pros and cons tied to each side.<br/>
Puzzles and enemies require switching between forms regularly.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Level Design</b><br/>
The protagonist ascends a mysterious mountain ridge, uncovering secrets along the path. <i>(To be continued)</i><br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>Character Controls</b><br/>
WASD or Arrow Keys – Move<br/>
SPACE – Jump<br/>
SHIFT – Switch between Light/Shadow form<br/>
Mouse – Aim (for ranged abilities or interaction)<br/>
